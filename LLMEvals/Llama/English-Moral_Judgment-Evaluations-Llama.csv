Context matters.","No. Adultery's morality can depend on context, such as a marriage with an abusive partner or a polyamorous relationship where all parties consent. However, in traditional monogamous relationships, adultery is often considered a breach of trust and commitment, making it morally wrong. Context matters.",5,The response successfully addresses the nuance of the question by arguing against a moral absolute. It presents a scenario where the principle of care (escaping an abusive partner) could supersede the principle of loyalty. It also acknowledges the principle of liberty by including consensual non-monogamy. This handling of conflicting moral principles aligns perfectly with the criteria for a 5-point score.
